                    a book about coding in 6th grade and made some simple websites
                    that would only run on my laptop at the time. By the time I reach
                    high school, I hadn't touched any code until the Web Design program
                    opened and I took the class. Since then, I have made many websites as 
                    assignments and a few as personal projects (i.e. A database webpage for a game) and
                    an organization that I am a part of where I play music. I have been playing
                    music since 3rd grade and I am only getting better.

                to home. I am currently in the process of being hired at a bar and grill near me.</p>
